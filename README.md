Background

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Analysis: 
Charter schools have higher passing rates than district schools. Small to mediums sized schools also correlate with having higher passing rates. The higher school budget avaible per student does not seem to correrlate with a higher passing average. In conclusion, small charter schools have a higher success rate in having higher scores for both math and reading.
